This is a multi-label classification, with 2 labels:

0: passenger did not survive
1: passenger survived
Kaggle offers 2 datasets:

One Training set: 891 passengers whose label is known
One Test set (TS0): 418 passengers whose label is unknown
Goal: For each passenger, predict the label (0 or 1).

The evaluation metric is accuracy score.

The project is decomposed in 3 parts:

The framework of this notebook is:
